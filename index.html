          <h1>readpercent.js</h1>
          <p>Simple jQuery plugin to get the percent of a div scrolled inside the viewport. </p>
        </div>

        <h2>
<a name="welcome" class="anchor" href="#welcome"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome</h2>

<p>This is a jQuery plugin that offers an easy way to show reading progress to your users. There are a few ways to get the percentage value. Make sure to checkout the demo inside this page.</p>

<h2>
<a name="install" class="anchor" href="#install"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Install</h2>

<p>Make sure to include jQuery in your page.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-html"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"jquery.min.js"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>And then include <strong>readpercent.js</strong></p>

<div class="highlight highlight-html"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"js/readpercent-min.js"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<h2>
<a name="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<p>Works as a normal jQuery plugin. </p>

<h3>
<a name="get-raw-percent-0-100" class="anchor" href="#get-raw-percent-0-100"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Get raw percent (0-100)</h3>

<div class="highlight highlight-javascript"><pre><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'#content'</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">readpercent</span><span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div>

<p class="demo" id="demo1">Output: <span>0</span></p>

<h3>
<a name="get-rounded-percent-0-100" class="anchor" href="#get-rounded-percent-0-100"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Get rounded percent (0-100)</h3>

<div class="highlight highlight-javascript"><pre><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'#content'</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">readpercent</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
<p class="demo" id="demo2">Output: <span>0</span></p>

<p>I recommend you to append the previous methods to a <code>$(window).scroll</code> event to get live data.</p>

<h3>
<a name="fill-html5-progress-element" class="anchor" href="#fill-html5-progress-element"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Fill HTML5 Progress Element</h3>

<div class="highlight highlight-javascript"><pre><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"#content"</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">readpercent</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'#progress'</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>

<h3>
<a name="change-width--of-an-element" class="anchor" href="#change-width--of-an-element"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Change width (%) of an element</h3>
